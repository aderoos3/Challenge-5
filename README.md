# Challenge-5
## Anaylsis and Visualization of mice lab results

The goal of this project is the clean and visualize data from a lad study of mice on different drugs. The raw data is arranged into bar graphs, pie charts, line charts, and scatter plots to get a good understanding of how all the variables relate to each other. This repository has the Jupyter Notebook with the analysis in the Jupyter Notebook, and two csv files. 

Opening up the file with the code will show how the two csv files were read into pandas and then duplicates deleted. The assignment did come with some hints, so I wasn't starting from scratch. Additionally, our instructor gave us some hints as well. I made a bar graph and pie chart using pandas and pyplot. Then I did some outliers and boxplot manipulation. Finally, I made some line charts, scatterplots and a regression line.
